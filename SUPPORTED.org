***** Notes

- The list includes only the "main" types that are supported. Some related types might also be supported, notably, iterators over supported containers.

- Unfortunately, a version of "1.55" does not automatically mean that the printer will or will not work for other (earlier or later) Boost versions. It only means, or suggests :), the printer worked for that particular Boost version.

- The "Module" column lists where each printer is found, and the "Latest" column lists whether that module is loaded by =import boost.latest=. To import a specific module, use, e.g., =import boost.intrusive_1_40=. To import them all, use =import boost.all=. *NOTE*: When 2 or more printers supporting the same type are registered with and enabled with =gdb=, there is no easy way to control which one of them ends up being used. The best thing to do in such a situation is to disable (or not load) the one you don't need.
